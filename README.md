This project is a Tableau dashboard that provides interactive visualizations and key insights into the Netflix dataset, including trends across movies and TV shows, content types, genre distribution, ratings, release year analysis, and more.

It helps stakeholders or general users understand how Netflix's content is distributed across time, genre, countries, and formats.
